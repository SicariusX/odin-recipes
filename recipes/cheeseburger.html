    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The everyday classic that soothes the soul.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds chuck roast (ask your butcher to grind it for hamburger)
        <li>Healthy pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>6 slices sharp Cheddar cheese*</li>
        <li>6 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Condiments of your choice</li>
        <li>Bread-and-Butter Pickles homemade or store-bought</li>
        <li>1 red onion thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Shape the ground chuck into 6 patties, each about 1/2-inch thick. Be careful not to pack the meat too tightly or you'll end up with dry burgers. Sprinkle a healthy pinch of salt over each burger. Crack some pepper over the top as well.</li>
        <li>Prepare a grill or place a grill pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the burger over the heat, seasoned side down. Toss some salt and pepper over the now top of the burgers and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the burgers and cook for 2 minutes more. Flip the burgers again and grill for 1 minute more. Flip the burgers again, place a slice of cheese on each burger, and cook for 1 minute more. The burgers will be medium-rare. If you prefer your burgers cooked medium to well-done, transfer them to a cooler part of the grill or reduce the heat under the pan to medium-low and leave the burgers on the heat a little longer.</li>
        <li>Transfer the burgers to a warm plate but do not cover them. Place the hamburger buns, cut side down, on the heat and warm until the desired toastiness.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers and buns on a clean plate, using any condiments you like. You're now ready to bite into the tastiest, juiciest burger ever.</li>
    </ol>
