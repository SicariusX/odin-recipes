    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyday delicacy-plain version recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>a little bit of tapioca starch </li>
    <li>wheat starch (not wheat flour)</li>
    <li>rice flour</li>
    <li>tapioca flour</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Place a metal trivet on a large wok and fill it up with water, just barely touching the trivet.</li>
    <li>Make sure the pan you will use to steam the cheung fun can fit into your steamer (whatever it is you use, a pot or a wok). Mine is a 8×8 inch square pan</li>
    <li>You will need a lid to cover and steam the cheung fun</li>
    <li>Combine rice flour, wheat starch, tapioca flour, salt, oil, finely chopped green onion (optional),and water in a large mixing bowl</li>
    <li>Bring the water in the steamer to a rolling boil</li>
    <li> Place the empty pan in the steamer, cover with the lid and steam for about 2 minutes.This will give you a better result because the batter won’t be sitting on a “cold” pan for too long</li>
    <li>Give the batter a good stir EVERY TIME before you ladle it up.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter on the preheated pan, you’ll need about 3-4 tablespoons or a bit more of batter (or more depending on the size of your pan)</li>
    <li> The batter may dance around a bit because of the non-stick surface. No worries. Wear a heat-proof kitchen glove and gently swirl the pan to make sure the batter is covering the base of the pan</li>
    <li> Cover with a lid and steam for 4-5 minutes</li>
    <li>The cheung fun will turn slightly translucent and bubbly on certain spots. If it doesn’t look right to you, steam a bit longer</li>
    <li>Remove from the steamer</li>
    <li>Cool it down (this is important).Place the pan on top of a cold tap water you filled up in the kitchen sink. Let it cools down for 2 minutes or longer. If you try to roll the cheung fun while it’s still warm, you will find it sticky and wet</li>
    <li>After it cools down, use a rubber spatula to gently roll it up or fold it up from one end. I folded the cheung fun in this photo</li>
    <li>Look at how clean the pan is after steaming. Nothing stick to it because I cool the cheung fun down after steaming</li>
    <li> Put the empty pan back into the steamer and steam for another 1-2 minute. Repeat this before steaming the rice rolls. Trust me, it’s worth the effort!</li>
    <li>Repeat the process again and DO NOT FORGET TO GIVE THE BATTER A GOOD STIR EACH TIME. The flour tends to settle at the bottom after a while. If you don’t give it a stir, your cheung fun won’t come out right</li>
    </ol>
